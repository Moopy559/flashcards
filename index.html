                <b>Situation:</b> As Head of the Marketing department at
                ENERDRIVE | DOMETIC focused on UI/UX, I led and liaised with
                multiple cross-functional teams and contractors to ensure the
                successful re-engineering and design of the mobile app for our
                flagship product.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Task:</b> The task was to conduct user research and develop a
                new app with several new customer support features, a new
                user-interface design, and also ensure it met the requirements
                of several internal teams that would be supporting the app and
                end-users post-launch from a product and tech-support
                perspective. A particular challenge to overcome was the
                conflicting requirements and priorities across the different
                internal teams.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Action:</b> Following the Human-centred Design Process
                throughout this journey, I personally consulted with several key
                teams within the business to gather their insights for this
                redevelopment project, including the Product, Support, R&D,
                Warranty and Senior Leadership teams. I analysed user journeys,
                hosted multiple focus groups and conducted feedback
                presentations to ensure all stakeholders were aligned throughout
                the course of the project and it satisfied the needs of both our
                internal teams and the end-users alike.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Result:</b> Within 2 months, I had pitched a solution for the
                app redesign and gained buy-in from all relevant stakeholders.
                Using a combination of Adobe Creative Suite and Figma, I
                designed wireframes and prototypes for the new app and received
                sign-off from all of the involved teams to ship into
                development. It was considered a massive team success and
                developed a unified direction for our core product that all
                internal teams could rally behind.

                I begin by mapping out all of the individual tasks associated
                with the projects into a project management software, such as
                Trello or Monday. I then start assessing the importance and
                urgency of each task based on strategic alignment, deadlines and
                impact on stakeholders. Anything with imminent deadlines or
                those directly tied to critical business objectives are given
                higher priority.
              </li>
              <li>
                I’d then look at the availability of resources, including team
                members, budgets and technology for each task or project. I then
                assign skill sets and expertise accordingly. I’d also make sure
                that I’m transparent with my communication to stakeholders,
                regularly reviewing and adjusting my approach as I recognise
                that priorities and resources may be subject to change.

                <b>Situation:</b> Improved the user experience for our core 3
                product rangers - eSYSTEMS, Canopy Systems, and B-TEC Batteries.
                Customers would often come to the site wanting to compare the
                specifications of the products, however the user experience at
                the time was very cumbersome. Specs tables were not responsive,
                there was ambiguity over which product image related to which
                product. This made it difficult for end-users to find the
                correct information, but it also made it hard for our own team
                to keep the information accurate as were in a period of updating
                our branding and discontinuing old products.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Task:</b> I set out to design a new template for our product
                range landing pages to improve the user experience. The new page
                needed to reduce the amount of noise on the page, as to not
                overwhelm the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Action:</b> Once they had identified their key products to
                compare, they could then follow a link that would take them to a
                separate specs table. This specs table could make full user of
                the device’s screen size, meaning that it was now much easier to
                see all of the important information compared to before

                I would begin by identifying the key stakeholders from various

                objectives and also the pain points.
              </li>
              <li>
                Throughout this process I would conduct workshops, brainstorming
                sessions or interviews as required to ensure that all of the
                relevant nuances leading to these requirements are understood.
              </li>
              <li>
                I’d then meticulously document all requirements, ensuring
                they’re captured in a clear and concise manner. That
                documentation might include user stories, use cases and criteria
                to better illustrate the desired enhancements.

                I then collaborate closely with developers and technical staff

                and project timelines. This would all be backed by clear and
                consistent communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lastly, I would continuously seek feedback from stakeholders to
